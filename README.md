# Automation Testing of desktop website or mobile website

Selenium automates browsers which is a platform independent, open-source automated testing tool that is used to test 
web applications accross several browsers like Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and Safari. 
Selenium automates the test-cases(testing steps) of web application testing. Selenium removes the need for manual 
testing by automating regression tests. This saves testers several days of effort that goes into
manually testing every functionality of the software whenever a change is made to the source code. 
Selenium WebDriver drives a browser natively, as a user would, either locally or on a remote machine using the Selenium server.
